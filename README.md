# GymMate Backend (Spring Boot Modular Monolith)

GymMate is a modular monolith built with Spring Boot, designed to provide a comprehensive gym management system. It organizes features into cohesive modules while maintaining a single deployable unit for simplicity and speed during MVP development.

## 📢 Recent Updates

### ✅ November 20, 2025 - Tenant Context Fix
- **Fixed**: GET `/api/gyms` endpoint now works correctly (was returning 403 Forbidden)
- **Updated**: SecurityConfig to properly handle public gym listing endpoints
- **Enhanced**: TenantFilter for better public endpoint handling

👉 **For technical details, testing, and implementation gaps**: See `TECHNICAL_NOTES.md`

## Tech Stack

- **Java**: 21
- **Spring Boot**: 3.3.x
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (with Flyway for migrations)
- **API Documentation**: SpringDoc OpenAPI (Swagger)
- **Architecture**: Modular Monolith with Clean/Hexagonal Architecture principles

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular monolithic architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/main/java/com/gymmate/
├── shared/                 # Cross-cutting concerns
│   ├── config/            # Application configuration
│   ├── dto/               # Common DTOs
│   ├── exception/         # Global exception handling
│   ├── security/         # Security configuration
│   ├── service/          # Shared services
│   └── util/             # Utility classes
│
├── user/                  # User Management Module
├── membership/           # Gym & Membership Module
├── booking/             # Class & Session Booking
├── payment/             # Payment Processing
├── inventory/           # Equipment & Resource Management
├── analytics/           # Business Analytics
└── notification/        # Notification System
```

Each feature module follows a clean architecture pattern with four layers:
- **api**: Controllers, DTOs, and API endpoints
- **application**: Services and use cases
- **domain**: Core business logic and entities
- **infrastructure**: External implementations (repositories, adapters)
